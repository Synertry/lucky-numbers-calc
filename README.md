# Lucky numbers calculator
Whole code is based on PHP.
I may add additional languages.

This code was created as an application requirement for a company.
It's publishment on Github was intended to make the code "official" under my name.

Options:
Change $maxcount to any other form of natural integer to determine the range.
Change $sdisplay to 1 to activate step-by-step view.

I'll be happy to accept any improvements on this code in the future.

Demo.php added to demonstrate in HTML. Try it in https://www.w3schools.com/php/phptryit.asp?filename=tryphp_func_array.


## Visual instructions/demo

Open demosite by clicking the link with CTRL/STRG:

![alt text][Open Demosite]

Get the democode by clicking demo.php followed by the RAW-button:

![alt text][Open Democode]

Copy the democode with CTRL/STRG-A and paste it over the sample at the demosite:

![alt text][Copypaste Democode to Demosite]

Run the PHP-Code by clicking the green button once:

![alt text][Run Democode]

The following is optional and only showcases the depth of the code with a step-by-step display of the calculations.

Showcasing steps until 500 would be a bit much. So we can adjust the maximum random target range, by changing the variable $maxcount. You can also completely replace mt_rand with a set number:

![alt text][Option Max Number]

For the step-by-step display just change variable $sdisplay from 0 to 1:

![alt text][Option Display Steps]

Rerun the PHP-code and see the changes on the right side:
