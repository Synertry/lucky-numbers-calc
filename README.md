# Lucky numbers calculator
Whole code is based on PHP.
I may add additional languages.

This code was created as an application requirement for a company.
It's publishment on Github was intended to make the code "official" under my name.

Options:
Change $maxcount to any other form of natural integer to determine the range.
Change $sdisplay to 1 to activate step-by-step view.

I'll be happy to accept any improvements on this code in the future.

Demo.php added to demonstrate in HTML. Try it in https://www.w3schools.com/php/phptryit.asp?filename=tryphp_func_array.
